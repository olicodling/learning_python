# a tuple is a data structure. A structure where we can store multiple pieces of data.
# Tuples are immutable, they cannot be changed or modified
# Tuples are created using parentheses, lists use square brackets.

# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (4, 5)

# Print the first element within the tuple
print(coordinates[0])

# Attempting to change an element within the list, will return an error as they are immutable.
#coordinates[1]= 10
#print(coordinates)
